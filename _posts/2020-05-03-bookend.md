# Inspiration 

Before the quarantine period, the 3 hours in the pottery studio were among my favorite hours of the week. With soft music from the radio and chatter from other students, I was completely immersed in the present. Unlike most other aspects of my life, I rarely had a plan when I started kneading the freshly cut piece of clay. Even though Ben would be quite encouraging, I have to admit that I am not very good and still have a lot left to learn. During the last session before our city's stay-at-home order, a decorative dish for my parents' 25th wedding anniversary was ready for the kiln, and I built a bookend with a cylindrical flower holder.

Since then, the pieces probably found home on the studio's shelves. With the arrival of our many new air plants (gifted by Julia), we printed Bulbasaur planters as seen in a [previous post][prev-post]. However, some of our plants still needed a place, and my books remained held in place by candles. 

# Design 

We designed a bookend that fulfilled both of these purposes. We measured the air plants' radius and height to determine an average opening diameter (width - padding). Given the majority of our books are 8.5 x 5.5 inches, we approximated the bookend's height to be approximately half. Here's our code in openSCAD.

We were drawn to the symmetry as seen in our final STL. The lowest level contained dome-shaped openings for our plants. In contrast, the upper levels had cylindrical space to hold stationery and flowers.

# Troubleshooting

Our first printing attempt was halted by the thermistor accidentally falling off from the nozzle. As we tried to remove the failed build from the glass bed, parts of the bottom cracked and left a gaping hole. Concerned about the similar fate of our future prints, we upgraded Jules (our 3-D printer) with a [better carbon-silicone printing platform](https://www.amazon.com/Anycubic-43188-247109-Platform-Aluminum-220x220mm/dp/B075375HBY/ref=sr_1_28?dchild=1&keywords=3d%2Bprinter%2Bbed&qid=1588536618&sr=8-28&th=1). By forming strong cohesion, the heatbed allowed for much easier removal of the print. Despite the extra hours of installing the plate to fit our machine and calibrating, we were quite happy with the results. Ben also patiently changed printing parameters such as increasing the layer height to shorten our printing time by a third. 

# Final Reveal 
 
After 4 hours of printing, our books found new company on the shelf: a wood PLA bookend. As planned, our 3 air plants occupied the bottom level. The blue pencil with the inscribed "I need a god**** nap" was from a small stationery stand within the [Last Bookstore](http://lastbookstorela.com/), where we visited during our first ever trip together to LA. The baby's breath were dried and collected from a rose bouquet Ben gifted me for Valentine's day.

Our adventure with 3-D printing thus far has been a process of trial and error. I still miss my pottery studio. Though, for now, I am glad we had a chance to discover the magic of experimenting with PLA and Jules.

Here's some of the stuff we've been printing!

# Dishwasher Chopstick Catcher

When we wash chopsticks in the dishwasher, a few stragglers would find their way to the bottom of the machine as they slip through the holes at the bottom of the silverware container. This is a piece we designed and printed to custom fit our GE dishwasher and hold chopsticks in place for an entire wash cycle.

## Laptop Stand

While working from home, Ben bought a monitor and keyboard since his work laptop is one of the Macbooks with the crummy butterfly keyboard. To help save desk space, we printed a laptop stand to make it stand up on end.

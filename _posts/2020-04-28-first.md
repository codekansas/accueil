# Dishwasher Chopstick Catcher

It's really annoying to wash chopsticks in the dishwasher. This is a piece we designed and printed to catch chopsticks so that they don't go through the holes in the bottom of the container.

## Laptop Stand

While working from home, Ben bought a monitor and keyboard, since his work laptop is one of the Macbooks with the crummy butterfly keyboard. To help save desk space, we printed a laptop stand to make it stand up on end.
